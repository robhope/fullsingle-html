Hey Friend ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out the FullSingle HTML template repository. Each template is based off the _layouts_ in the free [FullSingle WordPress Plugin](https://onepagelove.com/go/fullsingle). 

## Remove the CC3.0 licenses for only $5
Each HTML templates holds a [CC3.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) - meaning you can do whatever you want (even commercially) but you need to keep the template footer credit linking back to One Page Love. To remove the credit simply buy a license on the template download page on One Page Love. These links can be found in the readme.md files in the respective template folders.

## Support

Email me bugs or any requests on [rob@onepagelove.com](mailto:rob@onepagelove.com) and I'll try point you in the right direction :)

Cheers,  
Rob
